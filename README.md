## Hyper Swipe Code Challenge

Tinder-esque web application made with ReactJS

The cards are sorted by clicking either the like or the dislike buttons,
and the results are stored in local storage.

The application does not scale fantastically, but should look decent on most screens (1024-ish px ++).

##### Install dependencies 
yarn install

##### Run project. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
yarn start
